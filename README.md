# ECE-355

Completed coursework for [ECE 355: Microprocessor-Based Systems (Fall 2020)](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~ece355/lab/ "UVic Course Page") at University of Victoria.

## PWM Signal Generation and Monitoring System

Using the ECLIPSE SDK and the STM32F0 Discovery board, an embedded system is developped for monitoring and controlling a PWM signal generated by an external 555 timer. In this system, an external optocoupler driven by the microcontroller on the STMF0 Discovery board is used to control the frequency of the PWM signal.

An overall system diagram is shown below taken from the [lab manual](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~ece355/lab/ECE355-LabManual-2020.pdf).
